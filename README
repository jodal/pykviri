About
=====

PyKviri is query API for Python collections.

The inspiration of PyKviri is LINQ, and especially the blog post "A Model for
Query Interpretation" at [1].

Usage
=====

You can find lots of query examples with explanations in the file
"examples.py". The file doubles as both documentation and executable doctests
for the API.

The entire library source can be found in the file "pykviri.py".

For easier installation, a distutils "setup.py" script is also included.
